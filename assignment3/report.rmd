#### 2.1

Introducing ( X_t = \log(Y_t) - \mu ), transforms the given Seasonal Autoregressive (AR) model into:
[ (1 + \phi_1 B)(1 + \Phi_1 B^{12}) X_t = \varepsilon_t ]
Expanding the terms:
[ (1 + (-0.38)B)(1 + (-0.94)B^{12}) X_t = \varepsilon_t ]
[ (1 - 0.38 B - 0.94 B^{12} + 0.3572 B^{13}) X_t = \varepsilon_t ]
Rearranging to isolate the residuals:
[ \varepsilon_t = X_t - 0.38 X_{t-1} - 0.94 X_{t-12} + 0.3572 X_{t-13} ]

To calculate the residuals, we shift the time index forward by one:
[ \hat{\varepsilon}{t+1|t} = X{t+1} - 0.38 X_t - 0.94 X_{t-11} + 0.3572 X_{t-12} ]

For model validation, we analyzed these residuals to check the i.i.d. assumptions:

Mean and Variance: The residuals had a mean of 0.0134 (very close to zero) and variance of 0.0442 (close to the expected value of 0.0484).
Independence: The ACF plot showed all autocorrelations within the significance bounds, indicating no significant correlation structure remaining in the residuals.

```
Moreover, we tested for Shapiro-Wilk, which yielded a p-value of 0.1516 > 0.05, meaning we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. 

These results support the conclusion that the residuals satisfy the i.i.d. assumptions, validating our specified seasonal AR model as an appropriate representation of the solar power plant data.
